      <h1>Here are some fun facts about pineapple:</h1>
      <ul class="factlist">
        <li>
          A pineapple is not the combination of a pine or an apple, neither is
          it any of the two. It is a fruit consisting of many berries that have
          grown and fused together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hawaiian call the pineapple “hala kahiki” because they thought the
          pineapple looked a lot like the “Hala” fruit. “Kahiki” is a word that
          means foreign.

          Pineapples eat you too. It sounds like a scene from a horror movie but
          its true. Pineapples contain an enzyme called “bromelain” which breaks
          down proteins in your mouth. Hence, when you eat a pineapple, it is
          eating you back. Thankfully the stomach can break down the enzyme so
          there's no need to worry about being eaten from the inside-out.
        </li>

          In the 18th century, pineapples served as a status symbol in England.
          People back then can even rent one for the evening just to use it as
          an accessory to a party.
        </li>

          Pineapple makes a great meat tenderizer. Its bromelain content has the
          ability to break down the protein content of the meat.
